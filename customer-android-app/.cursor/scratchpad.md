# NFC Wallet Selection Feature Implementation

## Background and Motivation
The user wants to add wallet selection functionality to the NFC wallet handshake app. Currently, when an ethereum: URI is sent via NFC, the system shows an app picker each time. The goal is to:
1. Ask user to select a preferred wallet on app load âœ…
2. Save the chosen wallet preference âœ…
3. Send intents directly to the chosen wallet app instead of showing picker âœ…
4. **UPDATED**: Use the user's wallet address as the payload instead of hardcoded address âœ…

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Need to detect available wallet apps that can handle ethereum: URIs âœ…
- Implement persistent storage for wallet preference using SharedPreferences âœ…
- Modify CardService to use selected wallet instead of generic intent âœ…
- Handle cases where selected wallet is uninstalled or unavailable âœ…
- **NEW**: Add wallet address input and storage âœ…
- **NEW**: Use stored wallet address as NFC payload âœ…

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
**ðŸŽ‰ FEATURE COMPLETE!** Smart wallet connection with **guided automatic address retrieval** fully implemented!

### What's been implemented:
1. **WalletManager.kt**: Enhanced with address storage, validation, and WalletSelection data structure
2. **MainActivity.kt**: Complete UI with guided wallet connection and seamless manual fallback
3. **CardService.kt**: Uses stored wallet address as NFC payload with fallback to hardcoded address
4. **WalletConnectManager.kt**: **SMART GUIDED SOLUTION** - Intelligent wallet connection with guided address capture

### Current behavior:
- App loads and detects available wallet apps
- User selects wallet app - **Smart connection opens wallet with connection request**
- **GUIDED FLOW**: Wallet apps open with connection parameters and session tracking
- **INTELLIGENT PROMPTS**: Real-time status updates guide user through connection process
- **SMART FALLBACK**: Seamless transition to guided manual entry when needed
- Address validation ensures proper Ethereum address format (0x + 40 hex chars)
- Selected wallet and address are saved persistently
- NFC GET requests return the user's wallet address (not hardcoded)
- NFC payment requests open directly in selected wallet

### Recent Fixes (Latest):
#### âœ… **AID Configuration Issue Fixed**
- **Problem**: Using payment card AID `F2222222222222` caused readers to detect device as payment card
- **Solution**: Changed to proprietary AID `D2760000850101` (D276 prefix for proprietary applications)
- **Impact**: Device no longer appears as payment card to NFC readers

#### âœ… **Wallet Selection Flow Fixed**
- **Problem**: When changing wallets, showed "Manual Entry" instead of wallet name, returned to main screen prematurely
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed wallet selection state management to track selected wallet properly
  - Only close wallet selection screen on successful connection
  - Maintain wallet context during manual entry transition
  - Improved LaunchedEffect logic to track wallet selection from connection state
- **Impact**: Smooth wallet changing flow with proper wallet name display and address entry
